# This file configures the local relay that forwards LSL data to the cloud

# LSL Stream Configuration
lsl:
  stream_name: "X.on-055601-0004"  # Name of the local LSL stream to read
  # Will auto-discover stream by name

# Cloud Server Configuration

  api_key: "your-api-key-here"  # API key for authentication
  user_id: "default_user"  # User identifier

# Preprocessing Configuration
preprocessing:
  enabled: false  # Set to true to extract features locally (reduces bandwidth)
  # When enabled, will send features instead of raw samples
  # Features: band powers, ratios, etc.

# Buffer Configuration
buffer:
  size: 1000  # Number of samples to buffer when cloud is disconnected
